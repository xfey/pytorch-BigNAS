## Requirements

- Python >= 3.7
- PyTorch = 1.9

**Other requirements** are listed in the `requirements.txt`.

### Data Preparation

It is highly recommended to save or link datasets to the `$pytorch-BigNAS/data` folder, thus no additional configuration is required. However, manually setting the path for datasets is also available by modifying the `cfg.LOADER.DATAPATH` attribute in the configuration file `$pytorch-BigNAS/core/config.py`.

BigNAS uses ImageNet for training only, thus you can simply link ImageNet to the `data/imagenet` folder like this:

`ln -s /PATH/TO/IMAGENET $pytorch-BigNAS/data/imagenet`


## Run example

Adjust the batch size (and other parameters accordingly) if out of memory (OOM) occurs.

- Train Supernet (Multi-GPU only)
  `python train_supernet.py --cfg configs/train.yaml`
- Search
  `python search.py --cfg configs/search.yaml`
- Evaluation
  `python eval.py --cfg configs/eval.yaml`

The configuration file can be overridden by adding or modifying additional parameters on the command line. For example, run `eval.py` with the modified output directory could be like:
`python eval.py --cfg configs/eval.yaml OUT_DIR exp/220621/`


## Results

We are running this code under 4 \* NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs, and expect it to take over 20 days to complete training.

We are following configurations from `AttentiveNAS`. However, since we reduce the number of running GPUs, the exact results may vary depending on the different hyperparameters.

If you use this code to run and get results, we would appreciate you submitting it to us via Pull Requests.

### About XNAS

[XNAS](https://github.com/MAC-AutoML/XNAS) is an effective, modular and flexible Neural Architecture Search (NAS) repository, which aims to provide a common framework and baselines for the NAS community. It is originally designed to decouple the search space, search algorithm and performance evaluation strategy to achieve freely combinable NAS.
